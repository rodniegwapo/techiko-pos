## Available Mandatory Discounts

### 1. PWD (Person with Disability) Discount

### 2. Senior Citizen Discount

## IMPORTANT RULES

### ⚠️ Single Mandatory Discount Rule
- **ONLY ONE mandatory discount per transaction**
- Customer with multiple eligibilities (PWD + Senior) must choose ONE
- This is a regulatory requirement, not a system limitation

### 🔄 Combining Discounts
- ✅ **Allowed**: Promotional discount + ONE mandatory discount
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Multiple mandatory discounts (PWD + Senior)
- ❌ **Not Allowed**: Multiple of the same type

## Cashier Process

### Standard Process
1. **Verify ID**: Always check valid government-issued ID
2. **System Selection**: Choose appropriate discount in POS system
3. **Single Selection**: Select only ONE mandatory discount
4. **Receipt Documentation**: Ensure discount appears on receipt
5. **ID Retention**: Follow company policy on ID documentation

### Multiple Eligibility Scenario (PWD + Senior)
1. **Explain Limitation**: "You qualify for both discounts, but regulations allow only one per transaction"
2. **Provide Guidance**: "Both discounts are 20% off, so the savings are the same"
3. **Customer Choice**: Let customer choose their preferred discount
4. **System Entry**: Apply the selected discount only
5. **Documentation**: Note the chosen discount type on receipt

### Troubleshooting

#### Customer Questions
**Q: "Why can't I use both my PWD and Senior discounts?"**
**A:** "Government regulations require that only one mandatory discount be applied per transaction. This ensures compliance with disability and senior citizen laws. You can choose whichever discount you prefer."

**Q: "Can I use my Senior discount with this sale promotion?"**
**A:** "Yes! You can combine promotional discounts with your mandatory discount. The system will apply both automatically."

#### System Issues
- **Discount not applying**: Verify customer eligibility and ID
- **Multiple mandatory selected**: System will prevent this - choose one only
- **Calculation errors**: Contact supervisor for manual override if needed
